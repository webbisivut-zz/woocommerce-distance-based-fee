== Description ==

This plugin uses Google Matrix API to add custom fee based on distance between customers destination city and online stores location. Fee will be calculated by dividing the distance with user entered divider, and then multiplicated by the price. For example, if distance is 100km and the divider is 2 and price is 5 euros (Fee will be 5 euros for every 2 kilometers). The calculation formula will be (100 / 2) * 5 = 250 euros.
